Introduction
============

Welcome to the "Deliver Apps with Citrix ADC and Terraform" lab.

In this lab, we have provisioned -

1. Citrix ADC VPX
   1. `Citrix ADC NSIP (Management login) IP` for management access
   2. `Citrix ADC VIP (load balancer) Client IP` is the frontend IP for your apps in the backend-servers.
2. Two backend servers for you.

As part of the lab, we will achieve the following :
1.	Install Terraform CLI binary and Citrix ADC provider in a bastion host with access to the target ADC instance.
2.	Change Citrix ADC VPX login password using Terraform
3.	Configure Citrix ADC with two services corresponding to above backend servers and a load balancer to deliver them over internet all using Terraform.

For this challenge we will need to download and setup the terraform CLI binary.
Terraform provides instructions on how to download and install the
terraform binary in this [page](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).
All available terraform binaries are listed [here](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/). Letâ€™s get started with Terraform installation.

Install terraform
=================

For our purposes we will be downloading a specific terraform version known to work
with our current provider version.

1. Download the .zip file with the binary for the linux_amd64 platform

	```bash
	curl https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.1.4/terraform_1.1.4_linux_amd64.zip --output terraform_1.1.4_linux_amd64.zip
	```

2. Extract the executable in the current directory

	```bash
	unzip terraform_1.1.4_linux_amd64.zip
	```
3. Move the extracted binary to a location defined in the PATH variable

	```bash
	mv ./terraform /usr/local/bin
	```
4. Verify that the terraform binary is executable from the command line

	```bash
	terraform version
	```
	The above command should show you the version information of the terraform binary.
	> Ignore any out of date warning message.

Conclusion
==========

Having installed the terraform binary our next task will be
to apply terraform configurations.

Please proceed to the next challenge.
