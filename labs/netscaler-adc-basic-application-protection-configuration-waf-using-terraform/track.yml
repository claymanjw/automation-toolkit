title: NetScaler ADC Basic Application Protection Configuration (WAF) using Terraform
teaser: Learn how to leverage WAF Policies for protecting your Applications.
description: |+
  ## Learn how to leverage WAF Policies for protecting your Applications.

  On this Track we will leverage infrastructure-as-code templates to demonstrate:
  - How to create WAF policies and profiles.
  - How to enable WAF policies on load balancing or content switching virtual server level.
  - How to block or log malicious requests based on different criteria.

  The lab will provision for you a NetScaler ADC and a simple echo server. Then it will guide you on using Terraform to apply your configuration. Echo server is a simple application that echoes back the request it receives. We will leverage the echo server to showcase how our policies are applied based on the information contained in the request / response.

  During this lab we are going to send some malicious requests and see how NetScaler can either block or log these (by acting as a Web Application Firewall) based on the policies that are configured.
